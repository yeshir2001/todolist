Give me a roadmap to complete A To-Do List application project using a mern full stack

A roadmap to complete a To-Do List application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack involves:
1. planning,
2. building the backend,
3. developing the frontend,
4. integrating the two, and
5. finally deploying the application.

Phase 1: Planning and Setup
Define Project Requirements: Outline the core features:
Add new tasks (title, description, due date, status).
View all tasks.
Update tasks (e.g., mark as complete, edit details).
Delete tasks.

Set Up the Development Environment: Ensure you have Node.js, npm, and a code editor (like VS Code) installed.

Initialize Project Structure: Create a main project folder and separate directories for the backend (server) and frontend (client).

Set Up Version Control: Initialize a Git repository and create a GitHub account to manage your code.

Phase 2: Backend Development (Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB)
Initialize Node.js Server: Navigate to the backend folder, run npm init -y, and install necessary packages (Express, Mongoose, CORS, dotenv).

Set Up Database (MongoDB Atlas):
Create a free cluster on MongoDB Atlas.
Whitelist your IP address and create a database user.

Get the connection string and store it in a .env file in your backend directory.

Connect to MongoDB: Use Mongoose in your server file (server.js or index.js) to establish a connection to the database.

Create Data Model: Define the task schema using Mongoose (e.g., title, completed, deadline) in a models folder.

Define API Routes and Controllers:
Create a routes folder and a controllers folder.

Define RESTful API endpoints in the routes file (e.g., /api/todos for GET/POST, /api/todos/:id for PUT/DELETE).

Implement the logic for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in the controller functions using your Mongoose model.

Test API Endpoints: Use a tool like Postman to test that your backend API is working correctly before building the frontend.

Phase 3: Frontend Development (React.js)
Create React Application: In your main project directory, use npx create-react-app frontend or npm create vite@latest client to set up your React app.

Install Dependencies: Navigate to the frontend directory and install axios for making HTTP requests to the backend.

Build UI Components:
Create components for the main application, a form for adding tasks, and individual components for displaying each task (e.g., TodoApp, TodoForm, TodoItem).

Style your application using CSS or a library like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap.

Implement Application Logic:
Use React hooks (useState, useEffect) to manage the state of your tasks.
Fetch tasks from the backend API when the application loads using useEffect and Axios.


Phase 4: Integration and Testing
Connect Frontend to Backend:
Configure a proxy in the frontend's package.json file to route API requests to the backend server (e.g., "proxy": "http://localhost:5000").

Use Axios within your React components to call the backend endpoints for adding, updating, and deleting tasks.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): Ensure your Express server is configured with the cors middleware to allow requests from your frontend's origin.

Testing: Perform thorough testing to ensure the full-stack application works seamlessly:
Unit Tests: Test individual components and functions.
Integration Tests: Verify the connection between the frontend and the backend.
End-to-End Tests: Test the complete user flow.

Phase 5: Deployment
Prepare for Deployment: Optimize your code and set environment variables for production.
Deploy the Backend: Deploy the Node.js/Express server to a hosting service (e.g., Heroku, Render, AWS).
Deploy the Frontend: Deploy the React application to a static hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages).
Connect Deployed Apps: Update the frontend's API calls to point to the URL of the deployed backend server.
